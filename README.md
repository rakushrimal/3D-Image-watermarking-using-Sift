Digital watermarking is the technique developed to assure the protection and security of an image or any multimedia information. The main reason behind digital watermarking is to provide copyright protection along with data validation and content integrity validation.

Digital watermarking is a moderately new and very multidisciplinary research domain, which combines domains like digital signal processing with cryptography, communications, information theory, and the theory of visual perception. Without including any security information, it is difficult to precisely confirm the authenticity of the transmission content, thus digital watermarking is used to prevent the information from unauthorized users. Nowadays, 3D images are getting very popular. 

In this scenario, the copyright problem is the most challenging part. So to ensure secure image transmission and efficient authentication, 3D image watermarking using the sift operator scheme is proposed. 

Our main motivation is there are common regions in the left and right images. And if we can secure the left and right common content, it will be much more specific. 

The experimental results show that the proposed watermarking scheme is robust to different attacks such as common signal processing attacks, and geometric distortion attacks, including rotation, scaling, cropping, shearing, and some combined attacks.
